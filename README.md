# Project Progress Log  

## Gamified for E-commerce Live Streaming

### Project Overview  

This repository hosts my Master’s thesis project. It investigates how gamification (through missions, rewards, and AI-driven interactions) can enhance engagement, conversion rates, and brand loyalty in live-stream shopping platforms.

## Timeline and Progress  

### Week 1–2: Topic Definition and Literature Review  
- Defined research question: How can gamification enhance participation and trust in live-stream e-commerce systems  
- Reviewed literature on gamified UX, live-stream interaction models, and AI agents in engagement  
- Created initial concept map and user journey sketches  

### Week 3–4: Ideation and System Architecture  
- Developed three prototype directions:  
  1. Gesture-based reward interaction  
  2. Real-time emotion feedback for hosts  
  3. Audience contribution visualization  
- Finalized architecture using FastAPI for backend and Streamlit for frontend  
- Built a mock database using JSON  

### Week 5–6: Low-Fidelity Prototype  
- Designed Figma interface for host and audience dashboards  
- Built wireframes for main user flow: join room, earn points, view leaderboard  
- Integrated AI text generation using Ollama  

### Week 7–8: Implementation  
- Created FastAPI endpoints for event handling and user sessions  
- Built a real-time gamification engine for live interaction  
- Developed early Streamlit interface  

### Week 9–10: Testing and Refinement  
- Conducted usability test with 5 participants  
- Collected feedback on clarity and engagement  
- Improved performance and reduced event latency  

### Week 11: Visual Design and Documentation  
- Applied consistent visual system based on brand identity  
- Updated flow diagrams and technical stack illustrations  
- Started writing the final report (methodology and findings)  

### Current Status (October 2025)  
- Backend APIs functional  
- Frontend live demo completed  
- User evaluation ongoing  
- Preparing final documentation and submission (December 2025)
